## %% PocketLang is a small, fast and friendly language for scripting and embedding. %%

With mixed syntax of ruby and python, that can be learned in less than an hour, and it's easy to embed into another application for scripting.

```ruby
# Python like import statement.
from os import clock as now

# A recursive fibonacci function.
def fib(n)
  if n < 2 then return n end
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end

# Print all fibonacci from 0 to 5 exclusive.
for i in 0..5
  print(fib(i))
end
```

The complete language (including the internals and runtime) is a standalone executable with zero external dependency, that can be easily copied to a flash drive. And the language itself can be compiled from source in seconds without any dependencies (of course you need a C compiler and **optionally** a build system).
